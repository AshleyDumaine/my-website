			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>
			If someone had told me years ago that I would be on the cover of a magazine, create a mind-controlled quadcopter, help develop a native iOS app for a company, and land an internship at a tech giant all before my senior year of college, I most likely would not have believed them. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Despite having no programming experience prior to college, I have managed to stand out as an honors student in UConnâ€™s Computer Science and Engineering program. I enjoyed inspiring students of all ages such as at UConn's Open House events and the annual Connecticut Invention Conventions. Nowadays I work on developing tools and workflows to ease the hassle of building, testing, and shipping code at Connecticut's first ever unicorn.
